/*
In English (and many other languages), the imperative tense is used to give commands. 
Similarly, an imperative style in programming is one that gives the computer a set of statements to perform a task.

Often the statements change the state of the program, like updating global variables. 
A classic example is writing a for loop that gives exact directions to iterate over the indices of an array.

In contrast, functional programming is a form of declarative programming. 
You tell the computer what you want done by calling a method or function.
